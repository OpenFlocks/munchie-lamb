# Power
1. ## 2 x Drive Motors
	1. 6 volts
	1. n mAh
		* TO DO: research max mAh these generic 6v DC motors can take. 
		* Expect 1.1 amps will not burn them out.
	1. Battery
		1. [10 x D sized batteries](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/10-pcs-D-11000mAh-Ni-Mh-1-2V-rechargeable-battery-RED-/170712880328?hash=item27bf47d4c8), Ni-MH, 1. 1.2 volts, 1. 11000 mAh
		1. Join 5 batteries in [series connection](http://www.dcbattery.com/faq.html#6) to sum voltage (5 x 1.2v = 6v) but keep amps the same (1.1 amps).
			1. Note: batteries in parallel connection keeps volts same, sums amps.
	1. Configuration
		1. Buy 2 (2 x 4 battery, 2 x 1 battery = 10 batteries, 12 volts) [D size battery holders](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/4-D-Battery-Holder-/131004784066?hash=item1e807e5dc2)
		1. Test voltage and amps by connecting 3 battery holders to multimeter.
		1. Expect 12 volts and 1.1 amps as groups 1 + 2 +ve and -ve wires will be connected to input power on Dual Motor Controller.
